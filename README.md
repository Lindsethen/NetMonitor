![](Images/LogoAC.png)   
#### Application for monitoring network status
- DNS status
- WAN/internet status
- DHCP/IP status
- Connection speed
- Internet speed (run a speedtest on boot, then maybe       monitor how much is used and present it as a
bar to show how much speed is available)
- Possibly write a script to reboot the router (remote reboot by the click of a button)
- Display number of connected units
- Display number of packets going in/out at any time
- Adjustable parameters for checks (file sizes, timeouts)

## Initial planned frameworks
- Simple java command line application
- SQL hook for storing and presenting history
- XML/JSON API to get data on other devices

## Motivation
NetMonitor was created to be a part of a open source project at the University of Agder.
More specifically it exists as a contribution of an open source project for students in the subject IS-213 OPEN SOURCE
to contribute as an introductory idea of the open source working method.  
The developers of the project felt that it would be useful to have some sort of tool to easily access the functions mentioned above beneath "NetMonitor".
The maintenance within the project is to deliver a product concluding the subject IS-213.
Further maintenance will be unlikely, but the project is open for development and iteration.

## Code Style
Standard Javascript code style

## Screenshots
## Technology used
Built with IntelliJ, by JetBrains   
Developed with JDK 11     
Github Desktop & GitKraken

## Features
- DHCP/IP status
- WAN/internet status
- Internet speed (run a speedtest on boot)
- Adjustable parameters for checks (file sizes, timeouts)
- Display number of packets going in/out at a specific scenario


## Installation / Running
Provided by a Java Main which can be run in terminal.

## Tests
No test examples added.
Worked towards functionally rather than uptime/bugs

## How to use?
To use our project run the Main within the project in terminal for Mac OS X
 and run it within command prompt on any windows version allowing JDK 11.

 ## Contribute
