# NetMonitor
Application for monitoring network status

- DNS status
- WAN/internet status
- DHCP/IP status
- Connection speed
- Internet speed (run a speedtest on boot, then maybe       monitor how much is used and present it as a
bar to show how much speed is available)
- Possibly write a script to reboot the router (remote reboot by the click of a button)
- Display number of connected units
- Display number of packets going in/out at any time
- Adjustable parameters for checks (file sizes, timeouts)

# Initial planned frameworks
- Simple java command line application
- SQL hook for storing and presenting history
- XML/JSON API to get data on other devices
